# XNotify
This tutorial will go over sending Xbox Notifications from a tool.

## Code Example
`Console.XNotify(<text>, <type>);`

- `text`: this is a string, an example would be "Hello Xbox!"
- `type`: this is a number (int), that relates to what icon is shown, an example would be 14 for happy face"
